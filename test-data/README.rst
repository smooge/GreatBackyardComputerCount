Census From Mirrors
===================

Fedora and other systems maintain mirrorlists which use apache and
similar servers. By going through the logs we can parse out data and
store that as past data for census data. While this old data will not
contain UUID unless added by an administrator, it is still useful for
archive purposes. 

This reporting tool was based on an earlier written version that was
maintained at 

https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/roles/web-data-analysis/files/mirrorlist.py

This project supercedes it.
